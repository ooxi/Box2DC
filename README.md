Box2DC
======

Box2D C API for portability to other languages.

The majority of the API has been wrapped except for some of the lesser used classes, math functions and some C++ structs. If there is any interest in this project or I start using these other features myself I'll get to translating them eventually.

PLEASE NOTE: I am not a C programmer and there may be errors/oddities to be fixed in the general syntax. Please let me know if anything needs to be changed or contribute to the project.
